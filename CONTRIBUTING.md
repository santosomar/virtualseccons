# How to Contribute

[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are the best way to propose changes and submit new additions. You can also [create issues](https://github.com/santosomar/virtualseccons/issues) and I am more than glad to add / edit entries.

**Note:** [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. [This guide explains](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) how and why GitHub flow works.
